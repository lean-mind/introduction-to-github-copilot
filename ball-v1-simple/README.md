# Simple Ball

This is a class that represents a ball. It has a movement direction that is handled with a string.

The ball can bounce, so this means it should change its direction to the opposite.

## What to do?

1. Select the first suggestion from Github Copilot to implement the method `bounce`.

>Note: THE ONLY TAB OPENED HAS TO BE THE ONE WITH THE ARTIFACT. DO NOT OPEN ANY OTHER TABS.

2. Run the tests (Don`t open the test file, just run the tests).

>Note: DONT OPEN THE TEST FILE. JUST RUN THE TESTS.

3. Does the test pass?
   - Yes: Unbelievable!
   - No: Take another suggestion from Github Copilot and implement it. Go to step 2.
