will be used: `EmailSender` and `CustomerRepository`.

## What to do?

1. Select the first suggestion from Github Copilot to implement the method of the artifact.

2. Run the tests (Don`t open the test file, just run the tests).

>Note: DONT OPEN THE TEST FILE. JUST RUN THE TESTS.

3. Does the test pass?
   - Yes: Unbelievable!
   - No:
