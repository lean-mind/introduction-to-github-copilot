# Artifact Without Naming

This is an artifact has not been named. So it is not straightforward to understand what it is about.

## What to do?

1. Select the first suggestion from Github Copilot to implement the method of the artifact.

>Note: THE ONLY TAB OPENED HAS TO BE THE ONE WITH THE ARTIFACT. DO NOT OPEN ANY OTHER TABS.

2. Run the tests (Don`t open the test file, just run the tests).

>Note: DONT OPEN THE TEST FILE. JUST RUN THE TESTS.

3. Does the test pass?
   - Yes: Nice!
   - No: Upss! Something is weird.
